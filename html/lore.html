        <h3>BT (Before Tommy)</h3>

        <p>The “Before Tommy Era” was the beginning of the Dream SMP. In the beginning, the server was introduced as the
            survival world and only composed of the Dream Team and a few close friends. Everyone lived close to each
            other and the Community House was the core of the server.</p>

        <h3>AT (After Tommy)</h3>

        <p>The “After Tommy Era” saw a huge growth of members, nearly doubling the amount of the Before Tommy Era. As a
            result, the SMP had many more well-known events and builds than before. During this era, The Disc Saga and
            The Socializing Club Conflict took place. Historical builds during this era include Tommy's House, Punz's
            house, Purpled's Space Ship, Eret's castle, Tubbo's old house and Jungle base, and many more.
            During this period, nine new members joined the server: Tommy, Tubbo, Fundy, Punz, Purpled, Wilbur, Schlatt,
            Skeppy and Eret.
        </p>

        <h3>The War for L'Manberg Independence
        </h3>

        <p>The “War for L'Manberg's Independence” was an era of war between Dream SMP and L'Manberg. A new nation of
            L'Manberg was created after being tired of the Dream SMP thwarting drug trade that L'Manberg's economy
            relied on. War broke out after Dream refused to give L'Manberg independence. Many battles were fought, and
            members of the server were split. Historical builds were built in L'Manberg during this era included the
            Camarvan and L'Manberg Wall.
        </p>

        <h3>After L'Manberg War
        </h3>

        <p>The “After L'Manberg War” was an era of L'Manberg growth and the establishment of the religion Church Prime
            and Holy Land occurred. Jack Manifold and Nihachu joined L'Manberg, and many new buildings were built near
            L'Manberg by L'Manbergians. The era also saw the addition of Quackity and Karl, sparking new building
            projects on the Greater Dream SMP. In addition, a war between Sapnap and Fundy known as The Pet War also
            occurred, and an incident where Tommy ran over Dream with a minecart led to The Railway Skirmish.
        </p>

        <h3>L'Manbergian Election Era
        </h3>

        <p>The L'Manbergian Election was an era of campaigning, mainly between SWAG2020 and POG2020, for the presidency
            of L'Manberg. The election was originally started by Wilbur and Tommy to consolidate power, but Quackity and
            George entered the race. Late in the election, two third parties also joined the race for presidency.
        </p>

        <h3>Electoral Fallout</h3>

        <p>The Electoral Fallout occurred following The L'Manbergian Election. After POG2020's loss, L'Manberg saw a
            huge shift in power, and was rebranded to Manberg under the new leadership of Jschlatt. The power shift in
            L'Manberg and the banishment of Wilbur and Tommy sparked a rebellion, and many plots to overthrow Schlatt
            were developed. Jschlatt also revealed more plans to remove what was left of L'Manberg, and most notably,
            the burning of the L'Manberg flag happened.
        </p>

        <h3>A New Era</h3>

        <p>The New Era saw the return of some original members and some growth in each faction. Members were divided and
            continued preparing for what was what to come. Internal conflict within Manberg developed after Quackity
            failed to please Schlatt. Ninja visited the server for a day, and Andrea Botez was allowed on the server
            after winning against George in a chess match. The War of the Burning Eiffel Tower occurred during this era
            following the death of Henry. The Dreamon Invasion also occurred during this era, starting The Dreamon
            Hunter business. In addition, MrBeast had a $10,000 Taco bell gift card hidden on the server, which many
            members sought to find.
        </p>

        <h3>Manberg Festival Era</h3>

        <p>The Manberg Festival Era was an eventful era where Manberg hosted a festival to celebrate democracy. This era
            includes the planning and the event. The Manberg Festival caused a shift in the opinions of The Jschlatt
            Administration. The Dreamon Hunter business also expanded with a newly built base to conduct Dreamon hunting
            business.
        </p>

        <h3>Festival Aftermath
        </h3>

        <p>The Festival Aftermath was an era of questioning alliances and a major disturbance in the Jschlatt
            Administration. New structures and schemes were formed, and events such as the Dreamon Hunter Invasion and
            Ponk's Experiment occurred in lieu of the ongoing Manberg Rebellion.
            Multiple builds were started; the Museum of the Dream SMP, Atlantis (also called L'Mantis, L'Hole Sitnalta,
            and Casa de Hole), Ponk's Thiccatron, and the Haunted Mansion.</p>

        <h3>Manberg-Pogtopia War Era</h3>

        <p>The Manberg-Pogtopia War Era is the era revolving around the rise of Pogtopian and formerly
            L'Manbergian/Manbergian citizens against Jschlatt and Dream during The Manberg Rebellion. A war has taken
            place, with the Pogtopians victorious. The Pogtopians reformed L'Manberg, but at a cost. Most of the land
            was blown up from the large amounts of TNT under L'Manberg after Wilbur pressed the button, and Technoblade
            betrayed Pogtopia due to his standards of destruction and anarchy not being fulfilled. Technoblade added on
            to the destruction by adding withers to the TNT. At the end of the day however, L'Manberg was reformed as a
            democratic nation and Pogtopia, the Slums, the railway to Pogtopia, the museum, and the cat cafe were
            annexed into L'Manberg territory, giving L'Manberg vast resources and territory to put it on par with the
            Greater Dream SMP. This era has also canonically taken the lives of two SMP members, Wilbur Soot and
            Jschlatt.
        </p>

        <h3>Reconstruction Era</h3>

        <p>The Reconstruction Era follows The Manberg-Pogtopia War Era. The L'Manbergians must rebuild from the ruins
            that are left from the destruction of the past era. The Tubbo Administration has re-established peace in the
            territories of L'Manberg. Technoblade has been banished far into a tundra forest. However, there is also the
            looming threat of the Badlands and Dream SMP. Tommy, who refused presidency of L'Manberg, is on a mission to
            reclaim his discs while having to face the consequences of being Vice-President.
            During this period, like every other post-war era, six new members have joined the server: Ph1lzA,
            ConnorEatsPants, CaptainPuffy, Vikkstar123, LazarBeam, and Ranboo. Lazar and Vikkstar formed Boomerville,
            Ranboo joined L'Manberg, and the other members remained independent.

        </p>

        <h3>Post-Banishment Era</h3>

        <p>The Post-Banishment Era is an era of broken relationships and retribution. TommyInnit is once again banished,
            forming Logstedshire with the ghost of Wilbur Soot. L'Manberg has turned into a communist "utopia" ready to
            fight and defend the little things they have left. The nation strives to make alliances and good relations
            with the rest of the server to fight against Technoblade. Another faction, Mexican L'Manberg, was also
            created during this era, with Quackity being the president. After a political protest and some conflict,
            they were finally recognized as an independent nation, and renamed themselves to El Rapids. The mysterious
            blood vines develop during this era.
        </p>

        <h3>Vengeance Era
        </h3>

        <p>The Vengeance Era is an era starting after Technoblade's execution. Technoblade and TommyInnit begin a
            reluctant alliance in order to reclaim Tommy's discs and for Techno to take revenge on L'Manberg. After the
            failed Techno execution, the Butcher Army of L'Manberg plots to assassinate Dream by hosting a new festival,
            along with a $100K challenge from MrBeast.
        </p>

        <h3>Disunion Era</h3>

        <p>The Disunion Era is the next step in society for the Dream SMP. L'Manberg is defeated and dissolved after the
            Doomsday War; the Dream SMP assert dominance. As the ex-L'Manbergians go their different ways, the world
            enters into a fragile peace while TommyInnit and his remaining followers prepare to have another battle
            against Dream. Ghostbur recruits multiple powerful members into a small team to study the art of necromancy,
            planning to test it out on dead members of the SMP. The militaristic and totalitarian faction titled the
            Badlands begin phase two of their grand plan to assert dominance over the server now that L'Manberg had been
            destroyed. Quackity begins to establish the roots of society, politics, and diplomacy.</p>

        <h3>Imprisonment Era
        </h3>

        <p>The Imprisonment Era is the era after Dream is imprisoned in Pandora's Vault. The server enters a new dawn
            where the members would be free of fear from Dream. Meanwhile, with Dream in prison, the Badlands becomes
            the most powerful faction on the server and forms a coalition titled Eggpire with other server members to
            release the egg to invade the weakened Dream SMP. Jack Manifold and Nihachu gain control of nukes and plan
            to kill Tommy with them. The beginnings of a capitalist and entertainment-based society take root, as
            Awesamdude and Quackity form a business partnership to take control of the newly formed economic system.</p>

        <h3>Prison Lockdown Era</h3>

        <p>The Prison Lockdown is the era following the Imprisonment Era. Following the security incident at Pandora's
            Vault, TommyInnit is locked into the prison alongside Dream. Awesamdude increases prison security, hiring
            more guards. With the absence of Tommy, Jack Manifold takes over the Big Innit Hotel, renames it the "Big
            Jack Manifold Hotel," and forms a partnership with Quackity, who is also starting a business in an attempt
            to gain power. After being locked in the prison with Dream for a week, Tommy eventually loses his last canon
            life after being punched to death by Dream.</p>

        <h3>Mourning Era</h3>

        <p>The Mourning Era is the era following Tommy's final canon death in Pandora's Vault. The members of the SMP
            mourn (or in some cases, celebrate) Tommy's death in different ways, and build various things in his memory
            as some of them try to figure out the reason behind the events that led to his death whilst not knowing
            Tommy was revived. This era also begins the union of The Syndicate; a group being assembled by Technoblade &
            Philza. Ranboo & Niki are among the first to be recruited.</p>
